All the neatos!!!
Scalable multiagent robotics project.

Ideas:
	-Synchronize movement to account for differences in each robot; formations
	-Follow a person like ducks!!
	-Change leaders on cue, change formations on input
	-Induct new robots on the fly
	-Intelligent responses within horde to inputs
		ex: obstacle avoidance while obeying inputs

Plan:
	-Two synchonized robots
		-We want the transforms to be working at this point; adding more as necessary
		-Let's aim for three in sync
	-Follow the leader robot
	-Formations
