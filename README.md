All the neatos!
Scalable multiagent robotics project.

This project done in collaboration with @cfong, Christina Fong

Please note that all the code we wrote is in folder ./neato_horde/scripts
While the run.hoard code is tested and running, the refactored code that allows for >2 robots has not yet been tested though is theoretically correct.
